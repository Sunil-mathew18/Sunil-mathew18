## Glad to see you here!&nbsp;visitors]

I am a Computer science  Engineer Student . I love programming, reading, writing and speaking.

As a engineer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, and my unequivocal love for making things that change the world.

That's why I like to make things that make a difference.
